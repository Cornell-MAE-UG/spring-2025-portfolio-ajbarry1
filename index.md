## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. I'm specifically interested in the aerospace and composite materials fields. 

Outside of coursework, I enjoy hands-on projects and design challenges. I've worked with detailed CAD modeling, mechanical testing, and drone prototyping during my internships, research, and on my project team. This summer, I plan to intern at the Center for Composite Materials, working on a project focused on developing machine learning applications for material optimization and manufacturing.
