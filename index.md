## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. 

Outside of coursework, I enjoy hands-on projects and design challenges. I've worked with detailed CAD modeling, mechanical testing, and drone prototyping during my internships, research, and on my project team.
