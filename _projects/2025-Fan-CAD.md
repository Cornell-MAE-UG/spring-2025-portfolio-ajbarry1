In 2025, in one of my courses I wa assigned a project to design a physical object I have using CAD.I chose to model one of the fans I have in my dorm. 

I chose to dissassemble it to better measure and match the design of the real object. I learned a lot about lofting with guide rails and it gave me practice with using splines to create organic shapes. It was difficult to try to match the exact look of the real fan, especially the complex shape of the blades, but during the process I discovered a lot of methods that I believe resulted in a close replica of the physical fan.
