As a final project for MAE 3270, Mechanics of Materials, I was tasked with analyzing a design for a torque wrench and designing an improved version. I used both hand calculations and ANSYS FEM simulations to perform the analysis. 

I wrote a MatLab script that iteratively determines the ideal geometries for the design to meet safety factor requirements as closely as possible and avoid unnecessary over-engineering. I developed the new design for the wrench in CAD, and imported it into ANSYS to perform FEM on it.
