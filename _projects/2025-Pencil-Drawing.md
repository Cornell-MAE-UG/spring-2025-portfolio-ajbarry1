In one of my courses, I had to dissasemble and analyze the workings of a multipart object. I chose my mechanical pencil for this, and it turned out much harder to disassemble than I initially expected.

I usually struggle at drawing and making accurate sketches, so this was a good learning opportunity and chance to practice.
